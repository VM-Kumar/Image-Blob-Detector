# Image Blob Detection
**Goal**:To detect circular blobs in images which are regions which have similar features with respect to pixel intensity.\
\The content is organized as follows:
1. [description_report.pdf](Image-Blob-Detector/description_report.pdf) -> detailed report of the project and code
2. [CODE.m](Image-Blob-Detector/CODE.m) -> Matlab code for blob detection(use the path to required image as mentioned in the code comment)
3. [TestImages](Image-Blob-Detector/TestImages) and [OutputImages](Image-Blob-Detector/OutoutImages) -> folders containing sample imput and output images
